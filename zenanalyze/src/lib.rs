//! Image content analyzers for adaptive codec decisions.
//!
//! Computes the numeric features used by oracle-trained decision trees
//! (originally `coefficient::scripts/fit_oracle_tree.py`) to drive
//! per-image encoder configuration. Every shipped feature is wired
//! into at least one fitted tree's splits per the 2026-04-25 audit.
//!
//! # Public API
//!
//! All public types are opaque. Construction goes through the
//! [`feature`] module:
//!
//! - [`feature::AnalysisFeature`]: stable identifier per feature
//!   (`#[non_exhaustive]`, `#[repr(u16)]`, sequential discriminants —
//!   ids are immutable once shipped).
//! - [`feature::FeatureValue`]: `F32` / `U32` / `Bool` tagged value
//!   with `to_f32` lossless coercion.
//! - [`feature::FeatureSet`]: opaque bitset with full `const fn` set
//!   math. The only "all features" entry is
//!   [`feature::FeatureSet::SUPPORTED`] — there is intentionally no
//!   `all()`. Production callers enumerate what they need.
//! - [`feature::AnalysisQuery`]: opaque request handle. Sampling
//!   budgets are crate invariants, not per-call knobs.
//! - [`feature::ImageGeometry`]: opaque `width`/`height`/
//!   `pixels`/`megapixels`/`aspect_ratio` accessors.
//! - [`feature::AnalysisResults`]: opaque queryable container.
//!
//! # Entry points
//!
//! - [`analyze_features`] — preferred. Takes any [`PixelSlice`] and
//!   an [`feature::AnalysisQuery`]. Native zero-copy on RGB8/RGB8_SRGB
//!   inputs; one-row scratch + `RowConverter` on anything else (every
//!   `zenpixels` descriptor: RGBA/BGRA u8/u16, GRAY u8/u16, RGB/RGBA
//!   f32 linear, PQ/HLG/Bt709, BT.709/DisplayP3/BT.2020/AdobeRGB).
//! - [`analyze_features_rgb8`] — convenience for packed RGB8 buffers.
//!
//! # Composition pattern
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use zenanalyze::feature::{AnalysisFeature, AnalysisQuery, FeatureSet};
//!
//! const JPEG_FEATURES: FeatureSet = FeatureSet::new()
//!     .with(AnalysisFeature::Variance)
//!     .with(AnalysisFeature::EdgeDensity)
//!     .with(AnalysisFeature::DctCompressibilityY);
//! const WEBP_FEATURES: FeatureSet = FeatureSet::new()
//!     .with(AnalysisFeature::Variance)
//!     .with(AnalysisFeature::AlphaPresent);
//!
//! // Orchestrator unions, runs once, hands results down.
//! let needed = JPEG_FEATURES.union(WEBP_FEATURES);
//! let r = zenanalyze::analyze_features(slice, &AnalysisQuery::new(needed))?;
//! let var = r.get_f32(AnalysisFeature::Variance);
//! ```
//!
//! # Threshold contract — iterating during 0.1.x
//!
//! Numeric thresholds and normalization scales in this crate are
//! converging during the 0.1.x line. Downstream consumers that
//! compile-in fitted models (oracle decision trees, content
//! selectors) must pin to a specific zenanalyze patch version and
//! re-validate / retrain whenever they bump it — feature outputs
//! change between patches whenever a real bug is fixed.
//!
//! Every breaking numeric change ships with a CHANGELOG entry under
//! the version it landed in. When the algorithm stabilizes (1.0),
//! the contract will freeze. Sampling budgets (Tier 1/2 stripe step,
//! Tier 3 block cap) are part of that contract — not exposed as
//! per-call knobs.
//!
//! # Tier architecture
//!
//! Five passes, each gated by what the requested [`feature::FeatureSet`]
//! actually needs. None of them materialize a full RGB8 buffer:
//!
//! | Pass        | Iterates over            | Reads               | Cost (4 MP) | Drives                                    |
//! |-------------|--------------------------|---------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
//! | Tier 1      | Stripe-sampled rows      | RGB8 (via RowStream) | ~1 ms      | luma stats, edges, chroma, uniformity, grayscale_score |
//! | Tier 2      | 3-row sliding window     | RGB8                 | ~2 ms      | per-axis Cb/Cr sharpness                  |
//! | Tier 3      | Sampled 8×8 DCT blocks   | RGB8                 | ~3 ms      | DCT energy, entropy, AQ map, noise floor, line-art, patch fraction |
//! | Palette     | Full-image (every pixel) | RGB8                 | ~1 ms      | distinct_color_bins                       |
//! | Alpha       | Stride-sampled rows      | **Source bytes**     | ~0.3 ms    | alpha presence / used / bimodal           |
//! | tier_depth  | Stride-sampled rows      | **Source bytes**     | ~0.5 ms HDR / ~0 ms SDR | peak nits, headroom, bit depth, HDR-present |
//!
//! Tier 1/2/3 + Palette read RGB8, going through `RowStream`'s `Native`
//! zero-copy path on RGB8 layouts and `RowConverter` row-by-row on
//! everything else. Alpha and `tier_depth` read source samples
//! directly — that's load-bearing for HDR (RowConverter doesn't
//! tonemap PQ/HLG; its narrowing clips to [0, 1] sRGB-display) and
//! for the alpha pass (avoids a precision-losing pre-multiply round-
//! trip on u16/f32 alpha).
//!
//! ## Why a separate `tier_depth`
//!
//! The standard tiers' threshold contract is calibrated on display-
//! space RGB8 bytes. HDR content's source samples encode dynamic
//! range that the RGB8 narrowing destroys; a 4000-nit PQ source and
//! a 100-nit-clipped SDR source produce byte-identical RGB8 streams.
//! Routing the depth tier through RowStream would have made it
//! literally impossible to surface HDR-aware features.
//!
//! Adding `tier_depth` as a fifth `const bool` axis to the dispatch
//! table would have doubled it from 16 to 32 monomorphizations for
//! near-zero benefit — the depth tier reads source bytes, not RGB8
//! rows, and shares no inner loop with T1/T2/T3 to specialize. So
//! it's wired as a runtime branch outside the const-bool dispatch.
//!
//! ## Feature-overlap notes (corpus-eval 2026-04-27)
//!
//! Empirical Spearman ρ across CID22 / CLIC2025 / gb82 / gb82-sc:
//!
//! - `aq_map_mean` ↔ `noise_floor_y`: ρ ≈ +0.91. Both fall when
//!   blocks are flat (low AC energy). They drive different
//!   downstream knobs (zenjpeg trellis-λ vs `pre_blur` strength), so
//!   keep both — but if a future consumer reads only one of them,
//!   delete the other.
//! - `noise_floor_y` ↔ `screen_content_likelihood`: ρ ≈ −0.88.
//!   Screen content is clean-by-construction; photos carry sensor
//!   noise. The signals come from different passes (T3 noise floor
//!   vs derived likelihood) and feed different knobs (`pre_blur` vs
//!   `Preset`), so the redundancy is descriptive, not load-bearing.
//! - `aq_map_mean` ↔ `edge_density`: ρ ≈ +0.85. Expected — both
//!   measure busyness. Keep both.
//!
//! All other feature pairs are at |ρ| < 0.85. No deletion candidates.

// `#[archmage::autoversion]` generates dispatch trampolines that
// don't always reference the unversioned base function.

/// # Layered defense against garbage outputs
///
/// 1. Dispatch axes are unioned with derived-feature dependency

///    so e.g. asking for `ScreenContentLikelihood` correctly gates
///    the palette pass on (it reads `distinct_color_bins`).
/// 2. [`tier3::compute_derived_likelihoods`] is itself const-bool
///    gated — even if the dispatch axes drift, a likelihood whose
///    deps weren't computed is left at default and never written.
/// 3. [`feature::AnalysisResults::get`] only returns values that
///    were both requested and written. Unrequested or unwritten
///    features come back as `None`. **Caller never sees garbage.**
///
/// # Wide gamut, HDR, and bit-depth policy
///
/// **The analyzer accepts every layout `zenpixels_convert::RowConverter`
/// can ingest.** Specifically:
///
/// - **24-bpp packed RGB** (RGB8 / RGB8_SRGB / RGB8 with Display P3 /
///   Rec.2020 / AdobeRGB primaries / non-sRGB transfer) — passes through
///   the zero-copy [`row_stream::RowStream`] `Native` path, byte-for-byte.
///   The analyzer's BT.601 luma weights produce slightly-different
///   numbers for non-sRGB primaries, and that's the principled outcome
///   — wide-gamut content has more saturated colour, so chroma /
///   colourfulness signals legitimately read higher.
/// - **RGBA8 / BGRA8 / Rgbx8 / Bgrx8** — alpha is analysed by the
///   separate alpha pass that reads the source descriptor directly.
///   The RGB tiers see a row-converted RGB8 view; for opaque pixels
///   that's identity, for translucent pixels it depends on the
///   converter's straight-alpha policy.
/// - **RGB16 / RGBA16** — converted to RGB8 by taking the high byte of
///   each channel. Crucially: an 8-bit image promoted to 16 bits via
///   the standard `u8 * 257` (or `u8 << 8`) doubling produces the same
///   high byte back, so analyzer features on a u8-promoted u16 source
///   are *bit-identical* to the original u8 (locked by tests). Genuine
///   16-bit content's extra precision feeds derived signals where
///   it's algorithmically meaningful (palette bins are 5-bit-per-
///   channel; sub-LSB drift in the bottom 8 bits doesn't change
///   uniformity / variance categorically).
/// - **f32 RGB / RGBA (linear or HDR)** — converted to display-space
///   RGB8 via the descriptor's transfer function. For SDR f32 content
///   normalized to `[0, 1]`, the round-trip from a u8 promotion is
///   bit-identical. For PQ / HLG / linear-light HDR, the analyzer
///   measures the SDR rendition — that's the principled choice for
///   features whose threshold contract is calibrated on display-space
///   bytes; HDR-aware analysis (peak luminance, HDR pixel fraction,
///   wide-gamut peak) lives in the future `tier_depth` work
///   (issue #120) and is computed directly on the source samples.
/// - **Gray8 / Gray16 / GrayF32 / GrayA{8,16,F32}** — converted to RGB8
///   by replicating the luma channel. Chroma signals are then trivially
///   zero, which is correct.
///
/// The point: per-image codec decisions don't usually break on a few
/// LSBs of luma drift. They break on the analyzer refusing to run.
/// The previous "opt-in via `analyze_features_lossy_convert`" gate was
/// over-defensive — every supported wide-gamut / HDR / 16-bit source
/// either round-trips through conversion as identity (u8-promoted) or
/// produces a rendering that is the legitimate signal for SDR-
/// calibrated features. We accept everything, document the cases
/// where the rendering differs from a byte-for-byte input, and give
