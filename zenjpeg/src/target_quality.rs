//! zenjpeg-owned perceptual-target encode loop.
//!
//! Per the per-codec-loop-ownership directive (2026-08-25), each codec owns its
//! own target/secant loop rather than delegating to a central dispatcher. This
//! module is zenjpeg's.
//!
//! [`search_target`] is the pure, dependency-free bracketed secant/bisection
//! core (the algorithm is shared, by construction, with zenavif's
//! `target_quality::search_target` — same math, per-codec copy by directive):
//! given a monotone score-vs-quality relationship and a trial closure that
//! encodes at a quality and returns the achieved score, it converges on the
//! *lowest* quality whose achieved score reaches the target band (which, under
//! monotonicity, is the smallest file that hits the target). It takes the metric
//! as an injected closure — zenjpeg CANNOT depend on `zensim` (zensim depends on
//! zenjpeg; the reverse is a cycle), so the loop owns the search and the caller
//! supplies the score.
//!
//! [`encode_with_target`] is the thin loop over [`search_target`] that returns
//! the actual winning encode: the caller injects a `trial(quality) -> (bytes,
//! score)` closure (which does zenjpeg encode → decode → score), and the loop
//! owns the search, selection, and
//! bytes bookkeeping. The metric+codec are injected so zenjpeg never depends on
//! `zensim` (that would be a dependency cycle — zensim depends on zenjpeg).
